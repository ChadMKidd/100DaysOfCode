<p> Today I started officially learning to code via <strong>Zero to Mastery by Andrei Neagoie</strong> on udemy. And I am using this 100 days of Code as a means to hold myself accountable.<br> 
  
  By the end of the 100 days I want to:
  <ol>
    <li> Have a good understanding of HTML</li>
    <li> Have a good understanding of CSS</li>
    <li> Have a basic understanding of Javascript</li>
    <li> Create an aesthetically pleasing and interactive site/app</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Bonus: dip my toe into Python</strong></li>
